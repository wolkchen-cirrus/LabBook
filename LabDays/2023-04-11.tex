\experiment{MAZ04}

\textbf{UCASS-AD-MAZ04-008 continued:}

The capacitor was replaced with no effect, the pulse actually exhibited the symptoms of a short in the TIA, across the input and output lines. The opamp soldering was, once again, redone: no effect. It was notied at this point that the digital board was not accepting commands, the bootloader firmware was redone and the unit started to draw the correct current, however the inner photodiode channel still looked wrong. Although the channel was not saturating (meaning the unit was probably at the correct gain) the resistor in the feedback loop was replaced (in case there was a short due to improper soldering). \textbf{The output appeared fine after this, and the uit registered counts with the fibre test}.
