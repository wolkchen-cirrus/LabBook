\experiment{PPDr}

PPD is no longer functional after returning from a campaign in northern Finland. There are no useful images on the screen. When the trigger threshold is lowered to 10, and the trigger PMT voltage is raised above 20, there are noise triggers.

PPD was removed from its pelicase, removing and breaking the seal of the 4 bolts. The inlet heaters were disconnected, and the pump was removed. The arduino was reprogrammed to not trigger the relays. PPD was suspended above  the pelicase on two poles. The grounding point was replaced and connected to the mains socket, the mains cable was also replaced with an English plug.
